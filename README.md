# MNIST-Classification-Keras
A simple, exploratory study on how to use Keras framework (with Tensorflow background) for a simple handwritten number image classification task using a Neural Network (Multi-layered Perceptron) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project was primarily made with the purpose of learning and getting familiar with the Keras framework, which efficiently streamlines the use of Tensorflow with intuitive, simple-to-use functional APIs. This eliminates the need of managing computational graphs in Tensorflow and allows us to easily play with the Neural Network Architecture. 

## Dataset 

We have used the renowned [MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) containing 60,000 train samples and 10,000 test samples of 28x28 grayscale images depicting numerical digits written by a huge number of human subjects.
